Project Title: Machine Learning Accelerated Calculation of absorption tail in Optoelectronic Materials

- Large SuperCell of GaN 192 Atom size
- 637 Distorted Structures + 1 Undistorted Structure
- DFT calculations used to calculate absorption spectrum and bandgap
- Temperature range for simulations 10k to 600k (Independent Variable)

Constructed Random Forest Model to predict Bandgap with features generated using Matminer Library
Constructed RNN LSTM Model to predict Absorption spectrum within (Urbach Tail range) with Curvature and Bandgap as predictors
